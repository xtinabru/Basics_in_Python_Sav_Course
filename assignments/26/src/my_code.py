Kuopio Birdwatchers needs a new monitoring database software. Your task is to implement class Observation.

class Observation contains following properties:
- species               - string
- number_of_birds       - integer (set 0 if <0)
- observation_time      - datetime
- position              - string
- additional_info       - string

The class contains a constructor, which sets values of all data members of the class.

Create getters and setters for each data members. Each getter prints message "getter", and each setter prints message "setter".

Implement __str__ method. The method outputs string containing class data fields space separated. For example string "crow 32 31.01.2020 Savilahti 'Wind, north 5m/s'" is created with following data:
- species="crow"
- number_of_birds=32
- observation_time=31st Janyary 2020
- position="Savilahti"
- additional_information="Wind, north 5m/s"

There are no requirements for the main program. You can, for example, create a test software to test functionality of the class.
